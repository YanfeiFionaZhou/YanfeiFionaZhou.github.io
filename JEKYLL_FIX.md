## Jekyll Build Error - Fixed! 

### The Problem
You encountered a Jekyll build error due to Ruby version and gem dependency issues. The main problem was:
- Mixed Ruby versions (2.6 system Ruby vs 3.1.4 rbenv Ruby)
- Architecture mismatch (x86_64 vs arm64 on Apple Silicon)
- The `google-protobuf` gem not loading correctly

### The Solution
I've fixed the issue by:

1. **Switched to Ruby 3.1.4** via rbenv (instead of system Ruby 2.6)
2. **Created `.ruby-version` file** to lock the project to Ruby 3.1.4
3. **Cleaned and reinstalled all gems** for the correct Ruby version and architecture

### To Run Jekyll Now:

Simply run:
```bash
cd /Users/deqing/YanfeiFionaZhou.github.io
bash local_test.sh
```

Or directly:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The site will be available at: `http://localhost:4000`
